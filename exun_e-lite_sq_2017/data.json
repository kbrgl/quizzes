    { "question": "Hello everybody out there using minix –<br>I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I’d like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).<br><br>I’ve currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.<br>This implies that I’ll get something practical within a few months, and I’d like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won’t promise I’ll implement them :-)<br><br>________ (_____@kruuna.helsinki.fi)<br><br>PS. Yes – it’s free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.<br>It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that’s all I have :-(.<br><strong>Initial announcement for what?</strong>",

    { "question": "X is a programming language designed to drive all sane programmers completely out of their minds through the extreme overuse of parentheses involved in writing even the simplest of programs. Many have theorized that God himself created the language as a form of punishment for the most evil of computer programmers. In reality, it was created as a part of a government conspiracy to drive all programmers not under their control insane so that they would wind up in the looney bin. By doing this, they hoped to obtain complete control of the programming world. Fortunately, their ultimate objective was not reached; however, thousands of programmers now spend their lives in mental institutions due to this horrible, malicious programming language. The name itself is derived from the speech impediment often developed by its users as a result of the permanent brain damage they suffer.\" Excerpt from the Uncyclopedia article for what?",

This technology was developed independently and before X, and both the university and the company have no affiliation with one another. Further recent work developed by Stanford University: Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution by Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahi and Li Fei-Fei has also been able to create real-time style transfer through video. The code for the previous papers is available at no charge at GitHub for research purposes. The X App (on the industrial front), and Style Transfer and Super Resolution (on the research front) has been made possible thanks to research and development in human perception, texture analysis, convolutional neural networks.",
